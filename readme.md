## Challenge: Catch the Frog

You're walking through a beautiful meadow, enjoying the warm, sunny weather, and dreaming away. 
Suddenly you see a frog sitting at the side of the road. It so lovely, that suddenly you feel the urge
to catch it, and hold it in your hand. No easy task, to be sure: the creature jumps away, 
again and again, like frogs use to do. You get tired of chasing him around, but your patience will be rewarded.
